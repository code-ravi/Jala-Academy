//Question 1. How to create a class, object, method and its signature

package com.javabasics;

public class One {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// To create a class, we use "class" keyword, for example: class Animal
		// To create an object, we use "new" keyword, for example: Animal a = new Animal();
		
		// A method is a block of code that can be resued by calling. to create a method, we needs to give a method name with it's return type
		// A method signature contains return type, modifiers, specifiers and arguments

	}

}
